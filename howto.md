## Connecting a Device to Mender

To actually connect a device to Mender you can use a firmware blueprint from 1NCE which will try and establish a connection to the Mender Portal.  
1. Get the blueprint [here](https://github.com/1NCE-GmbH/blueprint-zephyr/tree/main/plugin_system/nce_fota_mender_demo)  
> NOTE: you need to have a setup and ready-to-use 1NCE workspace, if you don't have it follow the [Getting started with 1NCE](https://github.com/itsoctotv/how-do-i-develop-with-zephyr-1nce-blueprints/blob/main/howto.md).
